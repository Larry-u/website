<p><a href="http://www.wrapthegift.com">Wrap the Gift</a> is a service that can wrap a digital item and mail it to someone as
    a gift. I took over this project nearly at its beginning and have developed every aspect of it.</p>
<ul>In general I enjoy
    <li>(mis)using the <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com">Yii framework</a></li>
    <li>setting up PostgreSQL</li>
    <li>following the REST services guidelines</li>
    <li>implementing my own OAuth scheme</li>
    <li>understanding Git & Github</li>
    <li>pulling out my hair setting up an Apache web server</li>
    <li>(accidentally) configuring the company's mail server</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.mobgen.com">Mobgen</a> is a mobile marketing company. I had the chance of proving my skills as a
    senior web developer.</p>
<ul>I was mainly
    <li>building web services to serve data to mobile applications</li>
    <li>trying my best to make websites work on most mobile devices (lol)</li>
    <li>setting up environments for my team to work with ease and standards</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9MtPqrjoog&feature=youtu.be&hd=1">MSLeague</a> was an online fantasy
    football game with trading and social features. I was the tech lead, coming in to organise and develop a big part of
    the application.</p>
<ul>I had fun
    <li>making decisions on the technologies to use</li>
    <li>arguing with the team on those decisions</li>
    <li>setting the environment and common practices of the team (one other dev and a QA)</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.velti.com">Velti</a> is a large mobile marketing company based in Greece. I was a UI developer
    for their SMS interactive campaigns department.</p>
<ul>I learned how to
    <li>create proper interfaces with PHP and Oracle &lt;shiver&gt;</li>
    <li>program in JSF and use awesome Java frameworks and libraries such as Spring and Hibernate</li>
    <li>optimise applications for usage volumes of thousands of transactions per second</li>
</ul>
<p>There's more of course, but I'm not going to write it. I'd be surprised if you made it this far!</p>

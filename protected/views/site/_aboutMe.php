<p>Hi! I am a <?php echo date('Y') - 1982; ?>-yr old web developer originally from Greece but currently stationed in the
    Netherlands.</p>
<p>I have been working on web applications and websites in general since 2005 and have not regret it yet.
    While sometimes life can be difficult to handle as a web programmer (or developer, or whatever you want to call it
    these days), I take pride at my work and always jump in joy when things <strong>WORK</strong>.</p>
<p>I am a supporter of Open Source software and Linux OSs. I really can't work on proprietary platforms, it limits my imagination!</p>
<p>Of course, I value my personal time a lot and use that time to enjoy things that don't involve me staring into the computer
    screen for hours.</p>
<p>So what do I do when I don't develop awesome gut-busting applications?</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Reading fantasy books. You can obsess over my literature likings at my
        <a href='http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7123024-subdee'>Goodreads profile</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Sports. Well, more like running and some situps. I find it difficult to find people to play sports with, and
        throwing a basketball around by yourself is not really fun.
    </li>
    <li>
        Write music. Yes I was doing that long before I became a programming slave, but I still enjoy composing awesome
        melodies. You may enjoy (or not) some of my old stuff at my
        <a href='http://www.soundcloud.com/subdee'>Soundcloud page</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Travelling. Yes I love seeing new places and reading about their history and culture, so when I get the chance (or if I can
        afford it), I go away.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>And of course, all these things I enjoy with my beautiful girlfriend!</p>
